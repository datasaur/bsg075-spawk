SPAWK Installation Instructions
*******************************

SPAWK is copyrighted (C) by Panos I. Papadopoulos and is an
open source GPL licenced software product.

Linux/UNIX Platforms
====================
To install SPAWK in Linux/UNIX platforms you can follow one of
the following two methods:

Binary Install	You can install the binary library `libspawk.so',
		or `libspawk_r.so', or both in a valid shared
		library directory in your local system, e.g.
		/usr/lib. If you use SELinux, or any other
		advanced security package, you may have to
		take some action to make SPAWK module fully
		functional.

Source Install	That is the recommended installation method. You
		download the current SPAWK version's tarball and
		follow the instructions below.

Source Installation Procedure
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
To install SPAWK from the source you have to follow the
following steps:

Download SPAWK tarball
----------------------
Enter http://code.google.com/p/spawk/Downloads and donwload
the SPAWK tarball. You may find several such tarballs.  It's
always safe to download the most recent version. There may be
some version qualifier (Alpha, Beta, or RC) in the version
name, but the version is guaranteed to work for previously
released features.

Extract SPAWK source files and directories
------------------------------------------
After downloading the SPAWK tarball, you have to extract the
source files and directories included in that tarball file.
Move yourself in a non-system directory (/root or /usr/tmp are
good candidates) and r un tar to extratct the contents of the
tarball:

	cd /usr/tmp
	tar xzf /tmp/spawk-2.4.1.tar.gz

You could, of course, had extract the files while downloading
the tarball using such utilities offered by your browser.

Configure the release
---------------------
After extracting the tarball contents, you'll not the tarball
file any more, so you can remove the tarball file.
Move yourself to the release just extracted source directory
and run configure:

	cd /usr/tmp/spawk-2.4.1
	sh ./configure

The `configure' shell script runs some checks on your system
in order to construct the `Makefile' needed to proceed. These
checks have to do with the existence of the gawk sources and
MySQL needed header files and libraries. If the files are not
found in your system, then you have to install them.

Awk source installation
-----------------------
In order to construct the `awk.h' header file, you must have to
download the gawk source tarball. In order to do that you can
enter the http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/ URL and download the
gawk source tarball of your local system's gawk version. To
check your local system's gawk version, run:

	awk --version

You can also use `wget' to download the gawk sourcetarball, e.g.

	wget --quiet http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gawk/gawk-3.1.7.tar.gz

After donwloading the gawk source tarball, extract the gawk source
files and directories, move yourself into the source directory
and run the `configure' shell script:

	cd /usr/tmp
	tar xzf gawk-3.1.7.tar.gz
	cd gawk-3.1.7
	sh configure

Ignore all the messages and just check for the existence of `awk.h'
header file. If found, then proceed. If you don't find the `awk.h'
file, then you must ask someone to help you in that installation!

MySQL downloads
---------------
If the `mysql.h' header is not installed in your local system, then
you have to install the development package of MySQL. Follow the
instruction of you local Linux/UNIX distro, e.g to install the
package in CentOS:

	yum install mysql-devel

If the client libraries are also missing, then you must download them
too. To download the libraries in CentOS:

	yum install mysql-libs

Now you must have installed the `mysql.h' header file and the
libraries `libmysqlclient.so' and `libmysqlclient_r.so'. If the
files are not installed in your system, then ask for help. Else,
you may proceed.

Reconfigure the SPAWK release
-----------------------------
After having installed the awk and MySQL needed files, then you
can run the `configure' shell script once again:

	sh ./configure

Now you mustn't see any error messages about missing files, so
you can proceed to SPAWK installation.

Compiling and linking
---------------------
Now it's time to compile the sources and link the SPAWK libraries.

	make
	make test

Installing SPAWK module
-----------------------
The default installation directory for the SPAWK module is /usr/lib.
You can change that directory by editing the `Makefile' and changing
the `PREFIX' variable set, e.g. PREFIX = /usr/local/lib. After setting
the `PREFIX' variable, you can install the SPAWK module:

	make install

You may have to take some more action if you use SELinux or some other
advanced security system. Please refer to your manuals about shared
(or dynamic) libraries advanced security guidelines.

Cleaning up
-----------
After installing the SPAWK module you'll no longer need the source
files and directories. You can leave the source files and directories
fo gawk and SPAWK, or you can remove them. It's up to you!
